Cat-Finder

Must confess that this is the very first time that I work on an application, I've never did anything with programming before. I hope this will be the first of many, looking forward to continue learning.

This is an App created to find that little furry friend that is part of our family. The objective of it is to find what kind of cat suites you best.  It is all based on the breed, age and some other characteristics that will help you find the perfect match. 

The application itself is  not complicated to understand, depending on the options that the user inputs, the program will show the breed, age, and characteristics of the cat that fits to the options selected.

One of the challanges while I was programming the app was the class CLI, due the several options that involve creating the app from the color of the font to the size of each cat.
